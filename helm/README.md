# PremiScale controller and supporting Helm charts

- [`premiscale`](https://github.com/premiscale/premiscale/tree/master/helm/premiscale) is the chart for deploying the PremiScale controller.
- [`premiscale-e2e`](https://github.com/premiscale/premiscale/tree/master/helm/premiscale-e2e) is a chart for e2e-testing the controller. Unless you're a developer, you won't need to use this Helm chart.
