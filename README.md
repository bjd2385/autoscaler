# PremiScale

PremiScale is a controller that brings autoscaling to on-premise infrastructure, with a particular focus on integrating with the [Kubernetes autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler).

## Architecture

PremiScale is a controller (or agent, depending on how you look at it) that administers virtual machine hosts and virtual machines by leveraging [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/). Libvirt is a stable (open source) hypervisor SDK and interface.

See the [architecture diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hjwaMVQESdU2KffEJ4FpWDC1hjVHCLZX/view?usp=sharing) for PremiScale, or check out the diagram below, for an overview of just the controller.

## Installation

See the [chart README](https://github.com/premiscale/premiscale/tree/master/helm/premiscale) for an overview of controller installation and configuration options.

## Development

### Dependencies

Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_1-install-dependencies), followed by running `asdf install` in the root of this project.

### Docker Compose

> **Note:** Some tweaks may need to be made to the repository's [compose.yaml](./compose.yaml) file to get the stack to run on your system.

```shell
yarn compose:up
```

This will bring up a number of local services for running the agent. To tear the stack down, simply run

```shell
yarn compose:down
```

### Remote

Connect to your development cluster of choice with kubectl access, followed by

```shell
devspace
```

This will bring up a development stack in a local or remote Kubernetes cluster of your choice. To start a local development minikube cluster for deploying the devspace stack to, run

```shell
yarn minikube:up
```

This cluster is also used for [running e2e tests](#end-to-end-tests), locally.

### Unit tests

Run unit tests with

```shell
yarn test:unit
```

### End-to-end tests

Run e2e tests against a live (local) environment with

```shell
yarn test:e2e
```

This command will

1. Stand up a local 1-node minikube cluster with 4 cores, 4GiB memory and 30GiB storage. *(Modify [./scripts/minikube.sh](./scripts/minikube.sh) if these resources are unsuitable for your local development environment.)*
2. Create a `localhost` docker registry redirect container.
3. Build both e2e (hosts a git repository with encrypted pass secrets that match paths found in [./src/test/data/crd](./src/test/data/crd/)) and operator container images, as well as push these images to the local redirect for minikube to access.
4. Installs both e2e and pass-operator Helm charts.
5. Run e2e tests.
6. Tear down the cluster and local registry, as well as cleans up locally-built artifacts.

### Coverage

Test coverage against the codebase with

```shell
poetry run coverage run -m pytest
poetry run coverage report -m pytest
```
