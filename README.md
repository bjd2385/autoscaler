PremiScale is a controller that brings autoscaling of virtual private infrastructure in local, self-hosted and datacenters, with a particular focus on integrating with the Kubernetes [autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler).

## Architecture

PremiScale leverages [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) to connect to hosts and manage the lifecycle of virtual machines.

The controller can be configured to run in two different modes, including a `kubernetes` (the default) and a `standalone` mode.

### Kubernetes

Starting the controller in `kubernetes` mode (the default) starts relevant components of the controller that allow it to interface with the cluster autoscaler.

</p>

### Standalone

In `standalone` mode, the controller starts its own metrics collection process. Users are required to provide a list of hosts on which virtual machines can be created. Users are also required to provide a list of autoscaling groups into which virtual machines the controller manages are organized.

## Configuration

The controller is configured in a couple ways, including its command line interface, environment variables (as indicated in the help text below), and through the required config file (all versions of which are documented [here](./src/premiscale/config/docs/README.md) in this repository).

<!-- [[[cog

import cog

cog.outl(f'```text\n$ premiscale --help\n{subprocess.run("poetry run premiscale --help".split(" "), stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL).stdout.decode()}\n```')
]]] -->

The PremiScale autoscaling controller for Kubernetes.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --token TOKEN         Platform registration token. Also available as the
                        environment variable 'PREMISCALE_TOKEN'. If no token
                        is provided, the controller will not register with the
                        platform and start in standalone mode.
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Configuration file path to use. Also available as the
                        environment variable 'PREMISCALE_CONFIG_PATH'.
                        (default: /opt/premiscale/config.yaml)
  --validate            Validate the provided configuration file and exit.
                        (default: false)
  --version             Display controller version.
  --log-level {info,error,warn,debug}
                        Set the logging level. Also available as the
                        environment variable 'PREMISCALE_LOG_LEVEL'. (default:
                        info)
  --log-file LOG_FILE   Specify the file the service logs to if --log-stdout
                        is not set. Also available as the environment variable
                        'PREMISCALE_LOG_FILE'. (default:
                        /opt/premiscale/controller.log)
  --log-stdout          Log to stdout (for use in containerized deployments).
                        (default: false)

## Installation

This project is intended to be deployed to Kubernetes, whether you intend to integrate with the cluster autoscaler or not.

See the Helm [chart README](https://github.com/premiscale/premiscale/tree/master/helm/premiscale) for an overview of controller installation.

## Development

### Dependencies

Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_1-install-dependencies), followed by running `asdf install` in the root of this project.

### Docker Compose

> **Note:** Some tweaks may need to be made to the repository's [compose.yaml](./compose.yaml) file to get the stack to run on your system.

```shell
yarn compose:up
```

This will bring up a number of local services for running the agent. To tear the stack down, simply run

```shell
yarn compose:down
```

### Kubernetes

Connect to your development cluster of choice with kubectl access, followed by

```shell
devspace
```

This will bring up a development stack in a local or remote Kubernetes cluster of your choice.

#### Minikube

To start a local development minikube cluster for deploying the devspace stack to, run

```shell
yarn minikube:up
```

When you're done and want to clean it up, run

```shell
yarn minikube:down
```

This cluster can also used for [running e2e tests](#end-to-end-tests), locally.

### Unit tests

Run [unit tests](./src/tests/unit/) with

```shell
yarn test:unit
```

Unit tests require you to install the relevant dependencies in your local virtualenv with poetry (`poetry install`).

### End-to-end tests

Run e2e tests against a live (local) environment with

```shell
yarn test:e2e
```

This command will

1. Stand up a local 2-node minikube cluster with 4 cores, 4GiB memory and 30GiB storage, each. *(Modify [./scripts/minikube.sh](./scripts/minikube.sh) if these resources are unsuitable for your local development environment.)*
2. Create a `localhost` docker registry redirect container based on `socat`.
3. Build both e2e and PremiScale controller container images, as well as push these images to the local redirect for minikube to access.
4. Installs both [`premiscale`](./helm/premiscale/) and [`premiscale-e2e`](./helm/premiscale-e2e/) Helm charts.
5. Runs the [e2e tests](./src/tests/e2e/).
6. Tear down the cluster and local registry, as well as cleans up locally-built artifacts.

### Coverage

Test coverage against the codebase with

```shell
poetry run coverage run -m pytest
poetry run coverage report -m pytest
```
